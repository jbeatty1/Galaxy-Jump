<!-- 
This prototype will implement the following:

- Separate player's physics body from sprite, so that the hitbox can be a little smaller than the actual graphic.
    - This means there has been an added check to the rebound method to ensure you can't horizontally kick off a floor or ceiling.
- Scrollable camera!!!!

For Galaxy Jump project.

This whole code is a modified version of the part7.html example at http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part7.
If you want to see what everything else is, I would recommend looking at the other parts in the tutorial.

This is made using the Phaser 3 game engine from https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser
